# Example of the app engine template usage.
#
# In this example, a flexible app engine environment is created.
#
# Pre-requisites: 
# to run this example ensure you have a bucket created with the required application
# code to be deployed. A good starting point is the "hello world" sample at:
# ../../tests/integration/src/flexible
#
# Replace the following with valid values:
# <FIXME:bucketName>: the name of your gcs bucket which contains the
#                     deployment files

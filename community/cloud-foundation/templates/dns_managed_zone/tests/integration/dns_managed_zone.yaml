# Example on how to use the dns managed zone template
#
# In this example, a dns managed zone is created
# via the `subnetworks` property of the `dns_managed_zone.py` template 
#
# Notice the `name` property for the `templates/dns_managed_zone.py` resource type is
# optional. If omitted in the properties, the DM resource name is used. If 
# defined in the properties, it takes precedence.
